## Welcome to Asteroids!

Asteroids! is a 2D space shooter made with Unity.

### Game

The game consists on kill as much as you can while surviving until the end of the level, killing/destroying will give you points that are going to be stored on a counter on the top-right. You have a total of 6 lifes, if you get hit 6 times you will die and you will have to play from the beginning.

At the end of the level you will find a boss that once he gets really hurt starts a rage mode. Be careful!

## Challenges during development
The most challenging thing it has been to have the most complete experience (gameplay, UI, music...) having the giving time (12 days), also I hadn't implemented any UI until now on Unity.
